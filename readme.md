Dev Tools Example
=================

Based on the error in the DevTools console "Uncaught Reference Error: showGlobal is not defined" on script.js:41, I went to the script.js file, found showGlobal on line 41 and updated it to showGlobals because showGlobals is the correct name for the function (I have made this assumption based on the context of the script.js file).
